Throughout, K refers to the max lines we should merge at a time. As of now, the
lone reference to this value is in update_parent at the end, and it is 
total / (10 * level). This is obviously nto adequate, but let's use it for now,
and maybe tune it Tuesday night before the demo after everything else is working.

TODO:
This is rather short, I think we've set up do_work and update_parent to support
merging K-sizd pieces already. So really we just have...


merge_work: implement merging max of K units at a time.


There's likely small changes that need to be made to do_work/update_parent, esp
wrt arguments and return values.
Expect locking problems, since we'd have a lot more items in teh queue now.
