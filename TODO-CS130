Throughout, K refers to the max lines we should merge at a time. As of now, the
lone reference to this value is in update_parent at the end, and it is 
total / (10 * level). This is obviously nto adequate, but let's use it for now,
and maybe tune it Tuesday night before the demo after everything else is working.

TODO:
This is rather short, I think we've set up do_work and update_parent to support
merging K-sizd pieces already. So really we just have...


merge_work: implement merging max of K units at a time.


There's likely small changes that need to be made to do_work/update_parent, esp
wrt arguments and return values.
Expect locking problems, since we'd have a lot more items in teh queue now.



Gene says: Potential bug: we're inserting work_units into queue with queue_insert(), but without locking them first.
Chen says: Two things on the short term todo list:
1) Fix horribly mutated output that comes out more than half the time.
2) Clean up all the if condition in do_work.

Long term:
1) Optimize.
2) Polish/Clean up everything.
3) How should we handle the GDSL situation? Possibly ask other group for their heap.
