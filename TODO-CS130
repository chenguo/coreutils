TODO:
1) Optimize do_work and merge_work further. Merge_work is ~4% of runtime.
   (Chen: Likely done... At least I'm out of ideas)

2) Find optimal expression for MAX_MERGE
   (Mike's on it, likely close to done?)

4) Polish code (i.e. comments, formatting)

5) Proper linking of GDSL / other heap implementation
     Maybe the trees from gl_oset?
   (Chen: Gene's on it... Done?)


Completed:
3) Clean up if statement in do_work and update_parent, or at least refactor.
   (Done by Chen)

6) If --threads=1 don't use merge queue (--threads=2 measured faster than
     so glen's sort so is not a concern)
   (Chen: no need, tests show threads=1 for our code is 5.15s, versus 5.6-ish
          for old implementation.)
   
7) Experiment with outputting at the top level of merge. Will be tricky,
     since we need to track the last line output for sort --unique
     purposes, but we'll be jumping in and out of the call.
   (Chen: done, it's faster. Only question is to pass pointers or use globals,
          consult Prof Eggert.)
   (Chen: consulted, should be passed, implemented.)

8) Update documentation: double check Glen's sort.c documentation (namely,
      USAGE and options descriptions, should be ok) and update
      doc/coreutils.texi.
   (Chen: done.

9) Find out why sorting 16 lines on 4+ threads doesnt work.
   (Chen: fixed)

10) Test script.
    (Done by Chris)

11) Fix lock up bug, occurs most frequently sorting small files using few
      threads.
    (Chen: done)
