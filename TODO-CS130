TODO:

1) Optimize do_work and merge_work further. Merge_work is ~4% of runtime.
2) Find optimal expression for UNIT_OF_MERGE
3) Clean up if statement in do_work and update_parent
4) Polish code (i.e. comments, formatting)
5) Proper linking of GDSL / other heap implementation
     Maybe the trees from gl_oset?
6) If --threads=1 don't use merge queue (--threads=2 measured faster than
     so glen's sort so is not a concern)
