These notes intend to help people working on the checked-out sources.
These requirements do not apply when building from a distribution tarball.
See also HACKING for more detailed coreutils contribution guidelines.

* Requirements

We've opted to keep only the highest-level sources in the GIT repository.
This eases our maintenance burden, (fewer merges etc.), but imposes more
requirements on anyone wishing to build from the just-checked-out sources.
Note the requirements to build the released archive are much less and
are just the requirements of the standard ./configure && make procedure.
Specific development tools and versions will be checked for and listed by
the bootstrap script.  See README-prereq for specific notes on obtaining
these prerequisite tools.

Valgrind <http://valgrind.org/> is also highly recommended, if
Valgrind supports your architecture. See also README-valgrind.

While building from a just-cloned source tree may require installing a
few prerequisites, later, a plain `git pull && make' should be sufficient.

* First GIT checkout

You can get a copy of the source repository like this:

        $ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/coreutils
        $ cd coreutils

As an optional step, if you already have a copy of the gnulib git
repository on your hard drive, then you can use it as a reference to
reduce download time and disk space requirements:

        $ export GNULIB_SRCDIR=/path/to/gnulib

The next step is to get and check other files needed to build,
which are extracted from other source packages:

        $ ./bootstrap

And there you are!  Just

        $ ./configure --quiet #[--enable-gcc-warnings] [*]
        $ make
        $ make check

At this point, there should be no difference between your local copy,
and the GIT master copy:

        $ git diff

should output no difference.

Enjoy!

[*] The --enable-gcc-warnings option is useful only with glibc
and with a very recent version of gcc.  You'll probably also have
to use recent system headers.  If you configure with this option,
and spot a problem, please be sure to send the report to the bug
reporting address of this package, and not to that of gnulib, even
if the problem seems to originate in a gnulib-provided file.
